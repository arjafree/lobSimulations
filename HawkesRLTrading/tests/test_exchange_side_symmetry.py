"""Pin the Ask/Bid symmetry of the exchange's book maintenance.

Motivation: the drift study found a `lo_deep` Ask excess of +12.32 (p<0.0001)
in the FULL simulation with the Hawkes kernels nulled, but only +3.83 (p=0.35)
in the isolated generator. With the kernels off the arrivals are Poisson at
exactly mirror-symmetric baselines, so a residual imbalance that appears only
when the exchange is attached has to come from the exchange's order handling.
Separately, a 200-path experiment showed the thinning fix accounts for only
about +0.52% of the +1.29% Ask-excess improvement credited to it, leaving ~0.77%
attributed to nothing -- and this is the leading suspect.

The concrete defect these tests pin is in `regeneratequeuedepletion`: the Ask
branch assigns `self.askprice = self.askprices["Ask_L1"]` (a scalar) while the
Bid branch assigns `self.bidprice = [self.bidprices["Bid_L1"]]` -- a LIST. It
does not raise, because `askprice - bidprice` then yields a 1-element numpy
array rather than a scalar, and size-1 arrays are truthy and round and compare
without complaint. It propagates: `Exchange` assigns that difference to
`Arrival_model.spread`, which the generator uses to scale the in-spread
intensities.

These tests DOCUMENT current behaviour rather than assert the fix, because 15
training jobs are mid-flight against this simulator and changing it would break
comparability. `test_bid_branch_wraps_bidprice_in_a_list` is expected to pass
while the defect is present and to FAIL once it is fixed -- at which point flip
it to the symmetric assertion below it.
