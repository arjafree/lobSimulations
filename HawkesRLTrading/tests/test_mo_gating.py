"""Pin the market-order inventory gates, legacy and symmetric.

The legacy gates in get_action are:

    mo_Ask (SELL) blocked when  inv < 1  OR  inv >= inventorylimit - 2
    mo_Bid (BUY)  blocked when  inv <= 2 - inventorylimit

At inventorylimit=25 that permits SELLING only on inv in [1, 22] but BUYING on
inv in [-22, +inf). Two things are wrong with it:

  * `inv >= limit - 2` blocks SELLING while the agent is very LONG, which is
    backwards -- a position limit should stop the trade that makes the position
    worse, and selling makes a long smaller.
  * its mirror, blocking BUYING while very long, is absent entirely, so nothing
    in this gate bounds inventory from above.

The exploration branch is looser still: no limit clause on the sell, and no bid
clause at all.

All of this is DORMANT in every run to date, because action_space_config=1
emits only u in {2,3,8,9} and never u=4 or u=7. It would corrupt any
action_space_config=0 run, which is why the symmetric mode exists. Legacy stays
the default so runs in flight and historical results are unaffected.

The separate "no shorting via market order" rule (inv < 1) is a modelling
choice, not a bug, and is deliberately kept in BOTH modes.

    Two separate things have to hold, and only the first is about convert_dict:

      1. The POLICY path under config 1 maps u through {0:2, 1:3, 2:8, 3:9}, so
         it can never emit u=4 (mo_Ask) or u=7 (mo_Bid), and the gates are never
         consulted.
      2. Market orders ARE still submitted under config 1 -- the inventory-breach
         path issues `mo = 4 if inv > 0 else 7` when |inv| >= inventorylimit --
         but it `return`s BEFORE any gating, so those orders do not pass through
         the gates either. They are forced liquidations, symmetric by
         construction (sell when long, buy when short), not position-taking.

    If the breach path is ever moved below the gates, the legacy asymmetry stops
    being dormant, so this test pins the ordering too."""
