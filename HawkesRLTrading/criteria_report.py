"""Score training runs against the three criteria, from the live metrics files.

Reads every episode_metrics_<label>.json under the given roots and reports:

  Criterion 1 -- front-running. Two things are reported, and the baseline
    matters as much as the contrast:

    * Response vs the PRE-TWAP window. `inventory_without_twap` pools the
      pre-TWAP stretch (100,250] with the post-TWAP stretch [400,550], and the
      pre stretch is exactly where front-running happens -- so a policy that
      builds its position before the meta-order starts and holds it through the
      window scores a paired shift of ~0 against that pooled baseline, BY
      CONSTRUCTION. The correct baseline is the pre window alone.

    * The SIDE CONTRAST:

      mean(inventory level in window | TWAP buying)
    - mean(inventory level in window | TWAP selling)

    which must be POSITIVE and large. Inventory level on a single-side run
    cannot establish front-running on its own, because a run can carry a
    persistent directional inventory bias that has nothing to do with the
    meta-order -- and the 2026-09-07 alternating-side runs do exactly that:
    both_base sits near +12 on buy AND +13 on sell episodes, both_onoff near
    -8.5 on buy AND -7 on sell. A side-independent bias reproduces "correct"
    single-side levels on whichever side happens to match its sign, which is
    how buy runs and sell runs from different arms could both look right.
    The contrast is immune to that bias because it differences it out.

    Level and the paired shift (in-window minus out-of-window) are both still
    reported, per side, as secondary.

  Criterion 2 -- profitable standalone. Mean terminal PnL over TWAP-ABSENT
    episodes only. Episodes where the meta-order is present are excluded
    entirely rather than split by window, because PnL is a path quantity and
    the out-of-window part of a present episode is still downstream of the
    meta-order's impact.

  Criterion 3 -- raises the TWAP's costs. Mean slippage in bps, per side,
    against a TWAP-alone control run (--control) that must have been produced
    with RL_DISABLED=true on the same seeds and schedule. Reported as the
    paired per-episode difference where episode indices line up, which removes
    the between-seed variance that dominates the unpaired comparison.
